- **Multiple Timers**: Create and manage multiple named timers
- **Calendar Selection**: Choose which Google Calendar to create events in
- **Settings Management**: Configure timers and calendar visibility
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: Connect with Claude Desktop for natural language timer control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS
- Node.js and pnpm
- Google Calendar API credentials (optional for development)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install --ignore-workspace
   ```

2. Build the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build:desktop
   ```

**⚙️ For Developers:**
- OAuth credentials are bundled with the app for distribution
- For development, you can override with your own credentials
- See [GOOGLE_SETUP.md](./GOOGLE_SETUP.md) for development setup

**🔐 Security Note:** 
- End users authenticate through Google's secure OAuth flow
- No credentials are stored locally until you authorize the app

## Usage

- Toggle calendar visibility in the main dropdown
- Edit or delete existing timers
- Connect with Claude Desktop

### Claude Desktop Integration

1. Click "Create Claude Desktop Config" in settings
2. Save the generated `.dxt` file
3. Install it in Claude Desktop to enable natural language timer control

## Development

The app uses:
- **Electron** for the desktop wrapper and menu bar integration
- **React** for the user interface
- **TypeScript** for type safety in the main process
- **Google APIs** for calendar integration
- **electron-store** for persistent data storage

### Key Components

- **TimerService**: Manages timer state, persistence, and calendar event creation
- **GoogleCalendarService**: Handles OAuth and Google Calendar API calls
- **Main Process**: Manages windows, tray icon, and IPC communication
- **React Components**: Provide the user interface for timer management

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
1. Compile TypeScript files
2. Package the Electron app
3. Create a distributable `.dmg` file (on macOS)
