          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Dingo Track ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. 
            This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our 
            time tracking application for macOS.

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            Dingo Track is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or 
            transmit any personal information to our servers. All data remains on your device.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Data Stored Locally</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Timer configurations:</strong> Names and calendar associations for your timers</li>
            <li><strong>Timer sessions:</strong> Start times, end times, and durations of completed timers</li>
            <li><strong>Google OAuth tokens:</strong> Stored securely on your device to access Google Calendar</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Google Calendar Access</h3>
          <p>
            When you connect your Google account, we request permission to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Read your calendar list</li>
            <li>Create calendar events in calendars you select</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We use Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Your Google credentials are never 
            stored by our application - they are handled securely by Google's authentication system.
